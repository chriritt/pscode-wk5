// Exercise 1: Calculate the Sum of Two Numbers

a + b = c

num1 + num2 = sum
print sum

ask for 2 numbers 
add the 2 number together 
print on the screen the sum of those 2 numbers


// Exercise 2: Check if a Number is Even or Odd
-------------------------------------------------
PSEUDOCODE
1. Start
2. Request input from the user for a number
3. Check if the number is even
    - If the number % 2 == 0, it is even
4. If the number % 2 != 0, it is odd
5. Print whether the number is even or odd
6. End
-------------------------------------------------

// Exercise 3: 
Write pseudo code that will perform the following.    

a) Read in 5 separate numbers.   
b) Calculate the average of the five numbers.
c) Find the smallest (minimum) and largest (maximum) of the five entered numbers.
d) Write out the results found from steps b and c with a message describing what they are

-------------------------------------------------
PSEUDOCODE
1. Start
2. Create a list to store 5 variables
3. Loop five times to read in five separate numbers
    - Request input from the user for each number
    - Add each number to the list
4. Calculate the average of the five numbers
    - Sum all the numbers in the list: sum = num1 + num2 + num3 + num4 + num5
    - Divide the sum by 5: average = sum / 5
5. Find the smallest number in the list
6. Find the largest number in the list
7. Print the average, smallest, and largest numbers with appropriate messages
8. End
